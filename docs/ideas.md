# Ideas
## Clearly Defined User Workflows
## Misc
- color conflict alert
## First page - Team View
- team color 
- dark/light theme
- cache webscraped data
- give attribution
- player attendence feature
- FAB for feedback
- web scraping is not generally done at runtime. Could I use serverless to run a scraping script?
- schedule
  - last game in schedule is larger with additional information
  - performance rating graph
  - all games vs next games view

## Second page - Generate via team
- access page by 
  - teamid and leagueid 
  - team page url
  - team name?

## TODO
 - title bar web component
 - convert players to JSON
 - convert schedule to JSON
 - Implement 'Next Game' 
 - center and color material icons
 - move team info to players sidebar area
 - add example nav menu attached to header FAB
